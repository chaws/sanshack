# run john reaper

# Actually, I wrote a small python program to go thru an adapted english dictionary
sed "/^...$/d" english_dict -i (remove accents and words with 3 characters or less)
sed "/^[A-Z].*$/d" english_dict -i # taking away words starting with upper case

# Open door
*********************************
* To open the door, find both parts of the passphrase inside the /out.pcap file
*********************************
in the sudo man page we can see that scratchy can run tcpdump and strings as user itchy
$ sudo -l
reading from file /out.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
scratchy@3dcc13b08c4c:~$ vim prettier 
scratchy@3dcc13b08c4c:~$ sudo -l
sudo: unable to resolve host 3dcc13b08c4c
Matching Defaults entries for scratchy on 3dcc13b08c4c:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin
User scratchy may run the following commands on 3dcc13b08c4c:
    (itchy) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump
    (itchy) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/strings

after that, I ran:
$ sh -c "sudo -u itchy tcpdump -qns 0 -A -r /out.pcap" >pretty

and got some interesting things:
- part1" value="santasli

# Copied from chris
sudo -u itchy strings --encoding=l out.pcap
part2:ttlehelper

# At workshop
Connected to the wall and needed to get to the deepest of my directories to get the passphrase
Using 'find', I got the deepest as : ~/.doormat/. / /\/\\/Don't Look Here!/You are persistent, aren't you?/'$
Then just cat the file 'key_for_the_door.txt' and 'open_sesame' it is!

# At Santa's Office
There's a terminal that says "Greetings professor falken", just follow the order just as in the movie:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXzNo0vR_dU
and then it'll get you to the passphrase
'LOOK AT THE PRETTY LIGHTS'

# At the workshop or somewhere else, playing with wumpus
after playing a couple of rounds, i read the rules somewhere else and got the wumpus!
Passphrase:
WUMPUS IS MISUNDERSTOOD

# At Santa's office, messing around with the train
I got the train management console. The way I got passed it is through a tip on the help menu saying "unLESS"
This means that the help menu is opening the 'less' program, which allows me to run arbitrary commands by pressing '!'
Then I used the '!' command to execute '!ls -lah /home/conductor' and then '!/home/conductor/ActivateTrain' and voi-la!!!!

I got back to 1978 and started exploring stuff around. After 5 min of nothing, I decided to go back to Santa's office
This time, I went to the reindeers house and santa was there!!!!! at DFER - Dungeon For Errant Reindeer
